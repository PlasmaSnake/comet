Cryptocurrency tracker web app

For the Cognizant-Platform by Per Scholas Java Developer class

For now, my goal is to create a prototype with dummy data but I aim to use the API when the data and website function together up to standard.

Dummy Data: Bitcoin information collected from the API using the CryptoCollector/script.py file, and the python package made by lagerfeuer.

TODO:
1. Model schema 
2. Wireframe for front end and user stories
3. Develop DAO for coin list
4. Display coin list
